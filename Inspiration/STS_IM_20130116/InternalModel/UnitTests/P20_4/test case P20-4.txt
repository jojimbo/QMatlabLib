Description:
As an STS user,
I want given a dataset of ceilings factors, the system to load the ceilings factors in STS,
So that I am able to maximize the shocked vol for equity, BF and RE in STS. The name of the data file is: volatility_cap.csv

Criteria:
Given a set of ceilings factors,
When STS can load the ceilings factor data,
Then I am able to maximize the shock of vol and vol sensitive instruments in STS. The number of tenors and indices should be flexible. The data cannot be negative or zero.

Test plan:
[1]
1)volatility_cap.csv

It is expected that STS is able to load this file. (base case)


[2]

1)volatility_cap_flexNrOfTenors.csv
-Under AEX-Volatility Cap 3 tenors are added: 800,900,1000
-Under USAGG_USD_UNHEDG_INDEX-Volatility Cap all tenors are removed, except 730.

It is expected that STS is able to load this set of data eventhough the tenors have variable lengths.

[3]
1)volatility_cap_flexNrOfInd.csv
-AEX-Volatility Cap has been removed.
TEST1_USD_TEST1_INDEX-Volatility Cap has been added (at the end)

This file should be successfully loaded into STS, meaning that STS is able to cope with flexible number of indices.

[4]
1) volatility_cap_negData.csv
-row 846 contains a negative number.

It is expected from STS to show a warning while loading this file.
