Description:
As an STS user,
I want given a dataset of RW scenarios, the system to load the scenarios to shock market data in STS,
So that I am able to calculate the value of my instruments under diferent scenarios to calculate an EC number.
The name of the data file is: ASE_dummy.csv all the files in scenario test files.
The RW scenarios will not be generated by STS.

Criteria:
Givena set of RW scenarios,
When STS can load the RW scenario data,
Then the RW scenario data is available in STS.
The data is in the standard ALGO fomat available on the sharepoint site and should be tested with a flexible number of risk factors and flexible number of scenarios and at least tested for the data set that will be used for year end reporting. The data can be negative or zero. There is a mapping table for the credit spread risk factors in the instruments file. The system should be able to load a file with 500.000 scenarios within 1 hour.

Test plan:
[1]

input:
1)ASE_dummy.csv
2)ASE_dummy_flexNrOfScen.csv

Use both of these files to load the data in STS. The first file contains 101 scenario's while the second file contains 50 scenario's including the base scenario.
It is expected that STS should be able to load both files, meaning that the loading is flexible with regard to the number of scenario's.

[2]

input:
1)ASE_dummy_flexNrOfRF.csv

This file contains 6 scenario's inwhich a new risk factor is added for each scenario, which is "RF_TEST1" with has the value 0.777 for each scenario. When this file is loaded, it must be verified that "RF_TEST1" is loaded as a risk factor.
