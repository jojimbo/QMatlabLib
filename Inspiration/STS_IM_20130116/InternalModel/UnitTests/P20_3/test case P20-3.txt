Description:
As an STS user,
I want given a dataset of vol factors for IR, RE, BF, Equity and FX, the system to load the vol factors to shock volatility correctly in STS,
So that I am able to shock the vol surface correctly based on the RW scenario shocks.
The name of the data files are:
- IR_vol_vol_factor
- RE_vol_vol_factor
- EQ_vol_vol_factor
- BF_vol_vol_factor
- FX_vol_vol_factor

Criteria:
Given a set of vol factor data files,
When STS can load the vol factor factor data for IR, RE, EQ, BF and FX,
Then I am able to shock volatility and volatility sensitive instruments in STS. 
The number of tenors for IR vol, equity vol, FX vol, BF vol, RE vol factors should be flexible. The number of currencies or equity indices should be flexible. The system should create a warning if the loaded data is negative or zero.  For IR vol it should load a variable number of option maturities and swap tenors. The system should read the IDEAL_header.csv file so that the system is not impacted by changes in the columns of the data files. 


Test plan:
[1]
1)BF_vol_vol_factor.csv
2)EQ_vol_vol_factor.csv
3)FX_vol_vol_factor.csv
4)IR_vol_vol_factor.csv
5)RE_vol_vol_factor.csv

It is expected that STS is able to load these data correctly.

1)BF_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfTenors.csv

For BCOPC3A2_INDEX-Vol-Factor:
120 day tenor added.

For BCOPC3A8_INDEX-Vol-Factor:
5475, and 9125 day tenors are removed.
RE_vol_vol_factor

For USAGG_USD_UNHEDG_INDEX-Vol-Factor:
19000, 19500, 20000 day tenors are added.

2)EQ_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfTenors.csv

For AEX-Vol-Factor:
19000, 19365, 19730, 20095, 20825, 21555, and 22650 day tenors are added.

For KLSE-Vol-Factor
all tenors are removed, except 18250 day tenor.

3)FX_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfTenors.csv

For EUR/BGN-Vol-Factor:
5475 day tenor is removed.

For EUR/USD-Vol-Factor:
18615 day tenor is added.

4)IR_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfTenors.csv

For AUD-Swaption-Vol-Factor:
5000-5500 and 7000-7777 tenors are added.

For BGN-Swaption-Vol-Factor:
1825-2555,3650-2555 tenors are removed.

5)RE_vol_vol_factor_flexnrOfTenors.csv
For ELUK_INDEX-Vol-Factor:
6000, and 6666 tenors are added.

For RMS_INDEX-Vol-Factor:
2555 till 10950 tenors are removed.

It is expected that STS is able to load these five files correctly without any error or warning. This means that STS is able to load independently of the number of tenors.

[3]
1)BF_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfEI.csv
TEST1_INDEX-Vol-Factor and TEST2_INDEX-Vol-Factor are added as new equity indices.

2)EQ_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfEI.csv
All indices are removed, excepts XU100-Vol-Factor.

3)FX_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfEI.csv
TEST1/BRL-Vol-Factor and TEST2/BRL-Vol-Factor are added as new currencies.

4)IR_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfEI.csv
All currencies are removed, excepts AUD-Swaption-Vol-Factor

5)RE_vol_vol_factor_flexNrOfEI.csv
TEST1_INDEX-Vol-Factor is added at the end of the file.

Here, it is expected that STS is able to load the data correctly, taking into account that the number of currencies/indices are variable. This shows that loading of data is flexible with regard to the number of currency/index.

[4]
1)BF_vol_vol_factor_negData.csv
the last row contains a negative number.

2)EQ_vol_vol_factor_negData.csv
row 126 contains negative number.

3)FX_vol_vol_factor_negData.csv
row 219 contains negative number.

4)IR_vol_vol_factor_negData.csv
row 3 contains negative number.

5)RE_vol_vol_factor_negData.csv
last row (81) contains negative number.

It is expected that for all these runs, STS should display a warning that there are negative numbers in the data.

1)IDEAL_header_headerChanged.csv

2)BF_vol_vol_factor_headerChanged.csv
3)EQ_vol_vol_factor_headerChanged.csv
4)FX_vol_vol_factor_headerChanged.csv
5)IR_vol_vol_factor_headerChanged.csv
6)RE_vol_vol_factor_headerChanged.csv

For this user story there are only two different file formats in the IDEAL_header file:
-Volatility - Term/TermSPEC (for the IR)
Volatility - Moneyness/TermSPEC (for the rest)

In IDEAL_header_headerChanged.csv the columns belonging to the above identifiers are reversed starting at the third column. The data files are then rearranged according to this file. It is expected that STS is able to load these files according to the header file.
