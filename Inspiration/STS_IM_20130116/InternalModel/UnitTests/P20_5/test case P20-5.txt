Description:
As an STS user,
I want given a portfolio file, 
the system to load the portfolio file in STS,
So that I am able to calculate the value and EC of different portfolios.
The information in STS should be available up to instruments level. 
The name of the data file is: portfolio.xml

Criteria:
Given a set of portfolio files,
When STS can load the portfolio file,
Then I am able to load for different portfolios in STS. 
The portfolio tree should be fully flexible with regards to hierarchy. The hierarchy has the following levels: ING Group, Division, BusinessLine, BusinessUnit, Product Family, Product Family Member, instruments. The non market instruments are defined at product family level. We assume the file to be symantically correct.

Test plan:
[1]
1)DV1BL4USIIM.xml

STS should be able to load this xml file, the tree should look like this:

1)ING_GROUP
	2)DV_1
		3)DV_1_BL_4
			4)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM
				5)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM_PF_20315	
					6)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM_PF_20315_ASSETS   
						7)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM_PF_20315_PFM_22071	
							8)MarketIndex_.SPX
						7)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM_PF_20315_PFM_22072
							8)MarketIndex_USAGG_USD_UNHEDG
					6)DV_1_BL_4_USIIM_PF_20315_NONMARKETDATA
						7)USIIM_IIM_3rd_Party_BUS_GP_20120711191504678
						7)USIIM_IIM_3rd_Party_OPR_GP_20120705145420952

[2] "test case poortfolio"

In this directory, a test case is available from the old IM model. 
The portfolio file is "test27-1-2_portfolio.xml".
The instruments file is "test27-1_instruments_RE.csv".
For mapping the non-market instruments, use "mapping_RT.csv" file.
For mapping Business Entities, use "mapping_BE.csv" file.

Eventually the "output27-1-2_EUR_0.95.csv" is the expected report in Euros and for the .95 quantile.
